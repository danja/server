# Journal : Server : 2024-10-19

## Postcrafts

To find what I've got :
```sh
danny@danny-desktop:~/github-danny$ find . -name content-raw
```
Ok, a lot, but many are marked old, so I'll dump those over in `/space/postcrafts-dud_2024-10-19`

Also tried :
```sh
danny@danny-desktop:~/github-danny$ find . -name manifest.ttl
```
Which picked up a bunch of [DAWG Testcases - NOT CURRENT](https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/DataAccess/tests/). #:todo I should probably have a look what they have in tests in `manifest.ttl`

```sh
danny@danny-desktop:~$ which p
/home/danny/github-danny/server/scripts/p
danny@danny-desktop:~$ cat /home/danny/github-danny/server/scripts/p
cd ~/github-danny/transmissions

./trans postcraft ../postcraft/danny.ayers.name

cd ../postcraft

git add -A
git commit -m 'latest'
git push
```

---

Ok, I've set up a new postcraft instance for server.

#:todo sort out scripts/aliases to run `trans` anywhere

```sh
cd ~/github-danny/transmissions
 ./trans postcraft ../server/docs/postcraft
 ```

Ok, that built the HTML at :
```sh
http://localhost/GITHUB-DANNY/server/docs/postcraft/public/home/
```

 #:todo make a #:t:processor `HTTPServer` - soon! For testing here, but is needed for loads of things

I need to drop the `home` dir.

Editing `server/docs/postcraft/manifest.ttl`

That *almost* worked. But there's stuff naming dirs in `transmissions/src/applications/postcraft/processors-config.ttl`

Break time.
