# Deploy Postcrafts

I wound up #:yak shaving for a *proper* deployment (#:transmissions submodules etc), but for #:pivot:spooky target tomorrow, I just want something quick & dirty. I've a fair idea about what I want, but it's mostly in my head right now. *Make it so...*

For now, just have a script build the #:postcrafts individually, but have them target the proper destinations via their manifests.

I also need a *common* location for postcraft layout - nunjuck templates, css & js etc. (later things like menus, search etc). Also one or two instances of those - minimal baseline for projects, mini-minimal for *partials*.  

While I'm doing this, I need to bear in mind some of the *next steps* - creating Turtle descriptions of content etc.

Concrete things (using gfm syntax to force myself to tick) :

- [ ] runner script
- [ ] targeted manifests
- [ ] base layout for (full) instances
- [ ] base layout for partials

#:todo #:postcraft #:ns terminology : add 'instances' and 'partials'

Tree for new stuff on server (as located on office machine) :

```sh
~/github-danny/server$ tree 2024
2024
├── common
├── danny.ayers.name
│   └── irl
├── elfquake.org
├── hyperdata.it
│   ├── partials
│   │   └── vocbench-explore
│   └── postcrafts
│       ├── server
│       └── transmissions
└── strandz.it
```

*'irl' there is already cruft, but I'll leave it as a note-to-self to put my projects in there'

Ready for a couple of *full* installs :

```
/home/danny/github-danny/transmissions/docs/postcraft
/home/danny/github-danny/server/docs/postcraft
```

and a *partial* :

```
/home/danny/github-danny/hyperdata/workspaces/hyperdata/articles/vocbench-explore
```

First the dirty script (`/home/danny/github-danny/server/deploy/deploy.sh`)

```sh
cd ~/github-danny/transmissions

./trans postcraft ../server/docs/postcraft # typical
./trans postcraft docs/postcraft # for transmissions, it's already in the root dir
./trans postcraft ../hyperdata/docs/postcraft # contains the partial
```

Weird, the last one of those breaks with:

```sh
TypeError: Cannot create property 'counter' on string 'progressive-scraper'
    at DirWalker.emitThem (file:///home/danny/github-danny/transmissions/src/processors/fs/DirWalker.js:54:25)
```

Ok, to push them towards the right destination, let me have a look at the `manifest.ttl` for each of those.

ew, `/home/danny/github-danny/server/docs/postcraft/manifest.ttl`, copied from the current version in use at `danny.ayers.name` is *pug-fucking-ugly*!! (Henceforth, **#:pfugly**)

Oh, maybe not too bad :
```turtle
# POST PAGES
t:PostPages a pc:ContentGroup ;
    pc:site <https://danny.ayers.name> ;
    fs:targetDirectory "public/entries" ;
    pc:template "layouts/mediocre/templates/entry-page_template.njk" .
```

> Funny, I've a vague memory of asking on one of the lists about block comments in Turtle (or maybe even N3, in the Apochelonos Era). I believe [timbl](https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/) responded by words to the effect of : "if it's long enough to need more than a line, then it's worth expressing in the RDF itself". Ok, but right now I want to comment out a big block in this manifest, see if anything breaks. I guess that's a UI thing.

#:todo implement block comment UI for Turtle in VSCode/#:hyperdata-desktop #:yak

So now :
`/home/danny/github-danny/server/docs/postcraft/manifest.ttl`
```turtle
# POST PAGES
t:PostPages a pc:ContentGroup ;
    pc:site <https://danny.ayers.name> ;
    fs:targetDirectory "/home/danny/github-danny/server/2024/hyperdata.it/postcrafts/server/entries" ;
    pc:template "layouts/mediocre/templates/entry-page_template.njk" .
```

Go :
```sh
 ./trans postcraft ../server/docs/postcraft

 ...
